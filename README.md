### How to run the app locally?

No need to change anything in the project such as "mongoURI"

Clone the repository and install all the required packages by running the command **`npm install`** in the project directory.

Use command **`npm run dev`** to run the app in development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
